# Automatic Thematic Analysis for Recorded Interviews

## UHG project 
The AutoInterviewAnalysis project is a sub-part of the UHG Capstone project and aims to streamline the process of analyzing interviews conducted in a studio setting.

The project facilitates automatic thematic analysis by splitting the audio into manageable pieces and converting them into text.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enable efficient analysis of interview data by converting audio recordings into text format. This process allows for the identification of keywords and important themes within the interviews.

## Key Features
1. **Audio Segmentation**: The project segments lengthy audio recordings into smaller, more manageable pieces to facilitate analysis.

2. **Text Conversion**: Utilizing speech-to-text technology, the project converts audio files into text format, making them accessible for further analysis.

3. **Thematic Analysis**: The converted text undergoes thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and keywords, providing valuable insights for program improvement.

4. **Program Enhancement**: By analyzing the identified themes and suggestions made by interviewees, the project aims to contribute to the enhancement of programs and services.
