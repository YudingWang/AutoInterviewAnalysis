      "Segment 0 says: perfect and then I know I just kind of gave a little feel like kind of before we get into things do you have any questions for us that would like be helpful for you for a little bit of background or anything really before we start asking you some questions\n",
      "Segment 1 says: for these conversations but it might not take\n",
      "Segment 2 says: we're really just trying to hear a lot about what your experience has been kind of like your thoughts your opinions so you'll see that kind of reflected in our questions they're sort of structured but we have a little like room for a flexibility you know just to kind of have a conversation more but we'll try to hold this to no longer than an hour so I know for you that'll be like a 9 a.m.\n",
      "Segment 3 says: you can kind of just get into things so is it kick things off and you can just kind of tell us a little bit more about your role at IAA and it kind of in a general sense as well as how that kind of plays into if at all the medical assistant specifically that apprenticeship program with uht yes so I'm one of the instructors for\n",
      "Segment 4 says: I was hired actually last year it's been a year now so it's a hit the first year mark working for IA I was actually working with a private school before teaching medical assistant so when they approached me if I wanted to teach for nonprofit I said yes because you know I want to have experience teaching for apprentices you know because you just really\n",
      "Segment 5 says: up to 1 year so when they gave me a background about what they do you know the training apprentices and that's kind of like give me an interest you know switching or might as well you know like with them and let me try and get experience so they have been specifically for that\n",
      "Segment 6 says: yes I mean our cohorts takes 10 weeks long in class so I do the theory part and somebody will do the skills and clinical side of the program includes the we have science classes like Anatomy\n",
      "Segment 7 says: geology of pharmacology we also actually integrated some customer service and professionalism courses some soft skills classes as well as the theory itself for the program which is for the medical assisting program the theory part of it and what about the soft\n",
      "Segment 8 says: what is this song it's going to get into sure it will teach them how to basically professionalism you know when they are ready for apply for a job like getting ready for them to you know applying\n",
      "Segment 9 says: for a job positions I mean even though they are already employed from the beginning with but this still part of the curriculum that we have to teach them soft skills are you kind of said you've been with i for a year and you were hired specifically for you know working with the medical assistant program how would you\n",
      "Segment 10 says: you're involvement in helping to kind of More Design you know what that program really looks or was intended to look like an implementation kind of setting aside you know what actually you know ended up happening when the French program was up and going did you have any involvement in sort of a planning phase of the medical assistant program yes so we started so basically when we were building the\n",
      "Segment 11 says: I was a part of the planning process so we start with the curriculum building after that the second process is the sourcing or marketing for the program including the recruitment so we did the interview part the orientation part and all the way to selection process until the whoever gets elected\n",
      "Segment 12 says: do the orientation again all the way up to the beginning of the first start so Human Resources they have their own part to do like the benefits their background checks and all that so being instructor so I was just assisting the project leader you know doing the recruitment face and would you say that you know in your role even though\n",
      "Segment 13 says: assisting do you think you were able to or you know you were bringing some of your experience or kind of inputting ideas into this kind of planning process yes because like I said there's so many applicants and we have to scream them and not read them right whatever you HD how much they want\n",
      "Segment 14 says: so my experience like selecting the best candidate you know academically professionally and buy you know it's like selecting somebody going to like a job offer and is there anything that you can recall that kind of stands out in your memory that you remember kind of pushing for like advocating for you know a component\n",
      "Segment 15 says: of the program in this planning phase or maybe the opposite sort of advocating let's not do it that way let's do it this way anything like that that you can kind of recall I mean when we do collaboration everybody listens to I mean everybody's idea so we pitching everything on the table so at the end of the day again for you know what a program\n",
      "Segment 16 says: that's at least it's not only us also uhg is involved right right so again there's so many ideas that we put in the table and sometimes it might not work for them and sometimes it might work for us you know vice versa so the fact that we started in face to face that was really a good idea and we were supposed to I was actually like me I would like to do face-to-face Theory like\n",
      "Segment 17 says: you know what I mean so they just want online free delivery so that's how we doing right now and moving forward in the future is going to be like that and the skills trainer they have in the classes so for that something or that kind of\n",
      "Segment 18 says: recommendation but if it's at odds with what UHD is leaning towards it's going to be the uhg call most likely or at least in this scenario that's how it kind of played out it sounds like yes okay okay great questions to that which hopefully kind of\n",
      "Segment 19 says: just like to know more about or I guess a bit more description of your role or what your role really ends up looking like when it comes to actually implementing the apprenticeship program so maybe if we start at like thinking about the timeline of the program and taking it from more of like the beginning of your work\n",
      "Segment 20 says: if you could just tell us a bit more about like what that has looks like for you all right so my girl doing the delivery of the education so I am in charge of basically delivering delivering the curriculum the education\n",
      "Segment 21 says: Roswell it's kind of like give them guidance to become successful and you know if they need help I'm always there like a support in any way that they need anything not only like anything from the classroom like sometimes they ask questions like outside the classroom like you know like I said the soft skills or like how it's going to be out there like what can you recommend during you know if I'm not already in a classroom\n",
      "Segment 22 says: I'm working in the field so those kind of questions you know I told you I might give them answers to give them you know feedback and give them like I said guidance and everything after the classroom face you know I still working tonight about\n",
      "Segment 23 says: that you know the job and what you going to do what they can do or something goes wrong and all that and when it comes to that kind of like questions you might get or the guidance that you kind of give that really maybe Falls more into the world of like personal life or outside of education and curriculum you can kind of keep it General but are there any sort of like common\n",
      "Segment 24 says: those are like common types of personal life problems that tend to come up or that you've noticed have come up when it's specifically comes to the medical assistant apprenticeship apprentices that you've worked with like kind of any kind of categories may be that I would say personal problem but it's like their long-term goals about the career so\n",
      "Segment 25 says: some of them wants to become an RN some of them wants to be someone or somebody you know you know in the future so I usually like recommend or give them suggestions what do you want to do in life in the future you mean your long-term career goals or every time I do lectures and that's what some professionals or other Healthcare if I mention something like physical therapy or Occupational Health Department in the future\n"

      "Segment 26 says: so they would ask me how to get there you know how to become a RN off what's the steps you know and some of them wants to become a doctor to you know so those type of things in general questions yeah so kind of it it's not unrelated you know to what you're talking about but it's definitely their own personal like path that they're kind of thinking about when they're asking about it and it sounds like they're ultimately trying to kind of scope out\n",
      "Segment 27 says: if they wanted to go become a physical therapist kind of scoping out that path forward right okay Manny was there anything you wanted to follow up with for this question\n",
      "Segment 28 says: open post class or one of the things that we understood from the other interviews was that they would be a weekly feedback meeting between the apprentices and the folks in charge right so what they discuss these career aspirations right after class or is it during that meeting okay because I have a project leader\n",
      "Segment 29 says: right now that they do one and one in the weekly to check in with the apprentices more videos being struck her I talked to them everyday so just randomly like something comes up like I could say like every week or every two days it's just like random questions something you know like something pops up on your mind you know they ask me right off the bat okay additionally when you teach material right so\n",
      "Segment 30 says: where's the you also talked about how you would like to do it in person in person as compared to a virtual right so what are the kind of what is the kind of Engagement that you see in both of these classes and what something that needs to be improved in either forms of delivery so there's a big difference\n",
      "Segment 31 says: play Charlie you don't see what's there what they're doing behind the camera obviously if the opening of the windows are they really paying attention you know and face-to-face you can walk around in the classroom next to them and you have to face-to-face conversation that's kind of like it doesn't give them another opportunity to do something else on the side so while you know online if you like this I'm doing my lecture\n",
      "Segment 32 says: turn off the really paying attention if the money is playing are they opening other windows or are they doing homework so this is like the the main concern or one of the challenges that we are actually facing right now doing the delivery online delivery for the theory parties kind of like noticeable\n",
      "Segment 33 says: in fact that you're seeing like lower homework grades or or is it kind of more like you can just get the sense like I'm not holding their attention like the same way where you have it you know that in person yeah the the participation it's very very nominal only for you that you know participate in the discussion because\n",
      "Segment 34 says: can you face to face again just like raise your hand or the interaction is right there because they physically see you in the front of them but online sometimes I see side conversations yeah so that's you know I'm really upset about everything and I see if they're not paying attention they like that having conversations some to the person next to them so they'll stop at things\n",
      "Segment 35 says: all the homework ways it's no big difference\n",
      "Segment 36 says: that's actually that makes me feel that they are participating in collaborating together so I'll do a group work so there's actually a class called communication skills so that's all for me my delivery I don't read the article I give them a class activity that they need to present to the class\n",
      "Segment 37 says: so in terms of the different activities right so one is the class itself then there's a specific in class activity that this homework right so do you feel that the students are able to manage everything within the given time frame oh yes yes our curriculum is closest or actually scheduled at least 45 minutes to an hour so so there's actually\n",
      "Segment 38 says: Spare Time towards the end of the day that will give them opportunity to catch up with anything like homework so that's a lot of spare time they can practice on your skills at the end of the day so we don't really see anyone you know well there's some you know some cases that homework are behind or more late but technically they are always on time for the homework\n",
      "Segment 39 says: we did not try to stretch them out but try to give them a little bit more time or extra time to catch up with anything so I didn't have these homeworks collaborative or is it individual okay so they are just like Theory the homework theory none of the there's no group homework that we can implement\n",
      "Segment 40 says: have you know like a very busy like family life or you know basically when they step away from the program\n",
      "Segment 41 says: time is quite occupied Oh yes most of them are single mom some of them have kids and like what I said because it was the curriculum is built as like a 7 to 4:30 job so they clock in when they come in and they clock out when they go home so technically they are on Personal time after they leave the classroom\n",
      "Segment 42 says: another thing is do you have any assessments apart from the in class activities and homework meaning are they put into a practice exam before they give their National certification yes right now they are in\n",
      "Segment 43 says: 8 week and we give them at least two to three hours to do a practice squad quiz or exam we have this qbank question mark for the certification test so yesterday they did one 150 questions for 3 hours and it's based on the NHA we have a software weaknesses and everything\n",
      "Segment 44 says: so that's like the one that we use for assessing their capabilities for ccma exam so if someone does not do well on the practice exam right so how do you prepare them for the actual one so we give them extra activity to do for example\n",
      "Segment 45 says: play low on pharmacology we give them study guides basically refresher classes for the certain subject in order for them to master it and catch up Works in\n",
      "Segment 46 says: class for example let's say you are the instructor and people do reach out to you for help with respect to both class material questions regarding homework and so on another thing that I also wanted to understand was that people would also reach out between themselves and switch out between themselves to understand certain Concepts in case you're not available or even otherwise right so do you see any form of an informal Network being formed to learn\n",
      "Segment 47 says: bring the students what do you mean by that so let's say the students from study groups between themselves for example there was the first cohort they did start a group outside the classroom towards the end like they are doing a group study for certification exam again on the classroom when we give them breaks in between they do have you know\n",
      "Segment 48 says: we give them time to study like quitting each other reviewing each other that's one something that I saw on the face-to-face class cohorts\n",
      "Segment 49 says: so our next couple of questions are kind of about more just like your opinions regarding the program itself or kind of anything that you've noticed about what kind of the idea behind the program is and if there's anything that kind of differs in reality from it so our first\n",
      "Segment 50 says: you know when your opinion have there been any noticeable differences between what was kind of proposed as the program design and then you know in reality how it has actually played out actually when we're building the curriculum I have no idea like how is this going to be like because I came from like a Traditional School it was actually for me it's actually more effective\n",
      "Segment 51 says: it's more effective because the point that they have their own Clinic to practice compared to the traditional school they have to find a clinic at the end of the program here your immersing the clinical side and the theory of the same time so the learning process is actually way better in terms of you know learning I mean you Learning Classroom\n",
      "Segment 52 says: in the next day you go to the clinic so that is actually a good or very very effective way to train someone in this career field and was there anything that came up as part of the program plan that you haven't seen happen or that just didn't seem to come to reality anything like that yes the fact that\n"

      "Segment 53 says: play it's paid internship I mean you train someone and their employee at the beginning of the first day I mean it's a paid Apprentice program so that's like I've never seen that before you know some apprentices you know they might just like train you but it's not paying you while you're learning you know what I mean so if you like a flight attendant we go to a training but they're not getting paid right so so this guys are getting paid and employee\n",
      "Segment 54 says: the benefits on the first day so that's kind of like a while for me you know I never seen that happen Okay so that's something that kind of super noticeable from the planning phase and you know it obviously has worked out and yes in implementation has there been anything that you think has not worked in reality that was part of the plan but it just has not worked well or has not occurred\n",
      "Segment 55 says: this might be not related but here in Las Vegas I was I was in the impression that I will be teaching only one area so when we had the Phoenix area so the first cohort at least I thought both I had both so they hired an instructor so that way I can focus on Phoenix and this is supposed to handle Las Vegas\n",
      "Segment 56 says: so it didn't work out the after the second that's the second cohort when the third call comes they change the change things so now I teach both end up teaching both at the same time yes at the same time oh okay gotcha right so the second coat I was just finished and this is Las Vegas\n",
      "Segment 57 says: and another Circle heart they give it all to me again so that the plan that didn't work out like why I guess why you have to instructors that you know that can one start talking to both yeah yeah so because it's all remote it's kind of like just adding people onto the so in your opinion you know as the instructor what is that kind of feel like\n",
      "Segment 58 says: in terms of the difference between just one you know location like just the Phoenix students versus what does it feel like with the Phoenix and Las Vegas obviously there's more you know students but what is that kind of player or how does that play out in in reality for you okay it was weird the first time because I when I was in classroom with the Phoenix remote watching us joining\n",
      "Segment 59 says: best online and then the second call heart I was online and I had to finish now it's actually better now that they combined together in one remote area so it doesn't matter if I'll be physically in Las Vegas and Phoenix is remote they feel like they get left out because I'm not physically present in\n",
      "Segment 60 says: classroom what is Las Vegas I'm present in the classroom so now when everybody is remote it's like I don't see the difference like what area were they at right yeah so everybody else says you know if you are in the same city let's say exactly exactly\n",
      "Segment 61 says: okay great thank you for that and kind of pivoting but again just kind of looking for you know based on your experience you know now having kind of worked with the program for about a year what would you and kind of like your own words describe as the goals of this medical assistant apprenticeship program support\n",
      "Segment 62 says: HD I mean they really need you know they didn't need employees and whatever is their goal is you know it's I mean I had an idea why they want to do a princess because it's actually more productive than hiring a regular employee so they can train them their own way so supporting USGS mission is you know how to create their own quality employee so\n",
      "Segment 63 says: I mean that's kind of like my goal as well you know to to educate them playing them and to become their employee so in my personal goal I mean for me myself is to like to have someone build a career from zero and see them grow and have a good career is very fulfilling that's\n",
      "Segment 64 says: play some why I got into the education face yeah like as the instructor yeah it's like when you see someone from zero knowledge until the 8:35 and have a good career it's just like I said rewarding and feeling you know what I mean so yes that's nice\n",
      "Segment 65 says: you're seeing come up as like the core goal for the medical assistant program which is you know ultimately for uhg really train these as you put it I think really nicely these like quality employees their own way you know aside from that are there any kind of secondary or like outer goals that you think it's maybe not the number one core goal But ultimately it is a goal of the apprenticeship program\n",
      "Segment 66 says: you've noticed or that is you know kind of been expressed to you even okay all right so yeah I wish everybody every big company will adopt this this program I mean so many companies out there that they not doing a premises program which is it really I mean working with me and I see the turn around and everything the productivity and I wish everyone is doing the same thing\n",
      "Segment 67 says: will train you to become part of our team you know I will hire you to become a part of your team you provide education with everything so I wish I mean like most big companies are doing the same thing so it's kind of like give more chance on a lot of people that you know they want to start a career but they don't know how and where and\n",
      "Segment 68 says: you know they don't want to go to school and bring him dance and you know some of them they don't want to some of them is hard to go to school and there's no income right now so that's why when I saw this photo\n",
      "Segment 69 says: in your opinion do you think the goals of the program are being realized like do you think you HG is achieving their goals\n",
      "Segment 70 says: yes all of them are you know most of the apprentices are employed the first day they have a spot again also it depends how many they want in a classes to like the the tell us we need this much people in this whole heart so I think we are meeting their goals for this princess\n",
      "Segment 71 says: okay then kind of transitioning to a bit more maybe kind of similar to what we've kind of touched on earlier just like to know more about your opinions on kind of like changes to the program either changes that you think should occur or kind of I'll explain a little bit more but I guess our first question is\n",
      "Segment 72 says: think there's any weaknesses to the program and how it is designed or implemented that you know if you were like in charge let's stay and you could make a change tomorrow that you would put forth or propose I don't see anything that we need to change right now I mean obviously in my heart we are revising\n",
      "Segment 73 says: revising the curriculum because some of them need to be updated you know things changes all the time especially in the medical field so we're trying to put a lot of any timely you know like classes that they need to learn because when they go out there we want them to be in the same place\n",
      "Segment 74 says: your knowledge is like up to date yeah yes you can you change the delivery format like if you were in charge would you bring it to in person I would love to me and it's a little difficult\n",
      "Google Speech Recognition could not understand Segment 75.\n",
      "Segment 76 says: you know like a seminar or conventions that they can go so they can be exposed more like like kind of like professional networking or involve like in a community\n",
      "Segment 77 says: yeah and I think related to this question is our next one is there anything that you think is part of the program now but in your opinion you feel is actually not needed like it could be taken away and you think the program would achieve its goals you know just fine is there anything that comes to mind\n",
      "Segment 78 says: you like that well like what I said we are in the middle of really restructuring the curriculum some of those in the program itself nothing if it's I don't I don't think I want to change anything I mean everything is and they need all of this\n",
      "Segment 79 says: how long before I hit the last couple questions no good please okay and everything to talking more about the apprentices themselves what do you think are the characteristics of a successful Apprentice okay they must be they have the will to learn will take pressure in studying because\n"

      "Segment 81 says: and I know you said you know you've kind of seen the program in the early stages when you're kind of like recruiting and stuff like that are these like aspects that these end up being things that you know you're kind of looking for in that recruitment phase like which one maybe like looking for applicants\n",
      "Segment 82 says: the apprenticeship program that really expressed their will to learn or their time management or is that something where ultimately if they can build it they'll be successful you know as the program goes on or is it something you know initially you think they should kind of have this okay yeah because I think some interview on the planning face and doing the interview\n",
      "Segment 83 says: I think somebody to present themselves already and mentioned that by getting to know the applicants actually you I can engage them if they're ready or not if they have more responsibilities towards their family side or or do they have like you know if they're willing to sacrifice of their social status\n",
      "Segment 84 says: those type of things during the selection face and then I think our kind of final question in the more formal questions that we have is you know what are you hope to see for the future of the apprenticeship program in general not only just I guess just for the program itself\n",

      "Segment 86 says: the USG will do it I mean there's a lot of big hospitals here and Clinics you know I wish they will offer those type of things as well like apprentices for medical assistant because it takes its expensive system takes its cost $20,000 I think yes and and they are getting paid that much so I wish\n",
      "Segment 87 says: just going to be more in the future and then maybe like specific to the uhg program what would you hope to see in the future for it I hope they will grow more right now we are let's say right now we have five in Arizona and then here so I wish the next time maybe at least you know\n",

      "Segment 89 says: I mean I wish they have an open lab Open Lab skills like you know they can go practice to because I love here is very limited if you share with the other employees so I wish they had more more Open Lab skills like during their time they can go in and practice what they're liking or whatever skills they need to practice or to master that's something that you know I want to see\n",
      "Segment 90 says: Manny did you have any questions that we could end with no I mean right now I'm pretty good with the question so far yeah let's proceed with it all the questions I had a good day thank you so much for taking my time to chat with us are there any questions at the end that you want to ask us it's\n",
